# Odin-recipes

Hey all, this is my first HTML project that I'm writing on VS code!

In this project, I'm making a simple (and probably ugly) website with some Italian recipes that I like!
I plan to use all the tool that I've learned on the Odin Project HTML foundation path, including paragraph elements,
heading elements, anchor elements for links and images elements.

The goal on this project is not only to start applying the HTML resources I have learned, but also to start using Git
in an efficient way and trying to create good and strategic commits with readable messages!
