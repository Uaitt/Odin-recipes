        <p>Hey! Fellow Odin Student, we have made the perfect lunch, the perfect dinner...now what do you think are we going to make?</p>
        <p>Obviously a dessert! Today we are talking about the perfect Italian dessert...gelato (yes it's not called ice cream!)</p>

        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>4 medium egg yolkls</li>
            <li>150g of granulated sugar</li>
            <li>350ml of milk</li>
            <li>250ml of heavy cream</li>
            <li>vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And now, as usual, time to cook!</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Whip the egg yolks with the sugar for 5 minutes, until you have a soft cream</li>
            <li>Meanwhile pour the milk in a saucepan and bring it almost to  boil</li>
            <li>Transfer the egg and sugar cream to a saucepan, pour the milk slowly and mix! You can also add at this moment the vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture in a container and freeze it for 5 hours. Keep in mind that you have to break the frozen surface every 30 minutes</li>
            <li>After 5 hours, take it out of the freezer, break it again and let it thaw for 15 minutes</li>
            <li>You just made some fresh Italian gelato, congratulations!</li>
        </ol>
